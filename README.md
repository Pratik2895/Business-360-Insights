In addition to technical skills, the course also introduced me to essential business-related terms and concepts that are crucial for data analysts and business analysts.

## Course Project Highlights

The course project provided a fantastic opportunity to put my newly acquired skills to the test. Under the guidance of my tutor, Dhaval Patel, I completed two tasks as part of the project:

1. **Customer Performance Analysis**: I evaluated if the customers in the 'Customer Performance' sales view are meeting the GM % (Gross Margin Percentage) target.

2. **Product Analysis**: I identified the top 5 and bottom 5 products based on GM % growth YoY (Year over Year) and the post-discounts % trend for each of these products.

## Interactive Dashboard

I am proud to share the interactive Power BI dashboard that I created for the project. You can access it here: [Business 360 Power BI Dashboard](https://lnkd.in/gq3YciGq)
