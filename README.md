Welcome to my Power BI portfolio, showcasing my skills and projects in data analysis and visualization using Power BI.
## About the Power BI Project

 Anyone interested in data analysis and visualization using Power BI. It covers a wide range of technical skills and essential business concepts, including:

- SQL
- Power BI Desktop
- Excel
- DAX language
- DAX Studio
- Project charter files
- Calculated columns and measures
- Data modeling
- Bookmarks and page navigation
- Dynamic titles and KPI indicators
- Conditional formatting
- Data validation
- Publishing reports to Power BI services

In addition to technical skills, the course also introduced me to essential business-related terms and concepts that are crucial for data analysts and business analysts.

## Project Highlights

 I completed two tasks as part of the project:

1. **Customer Performance Analysis**: I evaluated if the customers in the 'Customer Performance' sales view are meeting the GM % (Gross Margin Percentage) target.

2. **Product Analysis**: I identified the top 5 and bottom 5 products based on GM % growth YoY (Year over Year) and the post-discounts % trend for each of these products.

## Interactive Dashboard

I am proud to share the interactive Power BI dashboard that I created for the project. You can access it here: [Business 360 Power BI Dashboard](https://lnkd.in/gq3YciGq)

Please feel free to explore the dashboard and provide your feedback and suggestions in the comments section.





Thank you for visiting my Power BI portfolio, and I look forward to further exploring the world of data analysis and visualization!
